\item\contentsline{section}{/home/francesco/experimental\+\_\+ws/src/assignment1/src/\hyperlink{getPosition_8cpp}{get\+Position.\+cpp} \\*This node publishes a random position which will be used from the command manager node . In practice it simulates the pointing gesture from the user and the random travel in N\+O\+R\+M\+AL mode as well }{\pageref{getPosition_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{/home/francesco/experimental\+\_\+ws/src/assignment1/src/\hyperlink{Navigation_8cpp}{Navigation.\+cpp} \\*It simulate the navigation from the current position to the position requested by the client, taking into account the dimension of a map a priori chosen }{\pageref{Navigation_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{/home/francesco/experimental\+\_\+ws/src/assignment1/src/\hyperlink{State_8cpp}{State.\+cpp} \\*This code generates a R\+OS publisher node which publishes a string \textquotesingle{}play\textquotesingle{}, using a std\+\_\+msgs/\+String, on the topic Sate\+String each iteration which is defined by the time variable }{\pageref{State_8cpp}}{}
